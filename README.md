# Dashboard

A customizable and dynamic widget management dashboard built using **React** and **Vite**. This project allows users to manage multiple categories of widgets, search across all widgets, and dynamically add or remove widgets from categories. The project also features a modal for adding new widgets, with a user-friendly interface and a blurred background effect when the modal is open.
